My grandmother actually found Katie and booked her as a surprise for us, revealing it at our engagement party. She said that she had spoken to so many bakers and none of them seemed to care just as much as Katie, who understood that this wasn't just a cake, it was a part of the most important day of our lives. Katie has been so brilliant at being communicative. Nothing was too much bother and, after our consultation, she knew exactly the kind of thing I was looking for. When I asked if we could put little Disney ears on the bottom tier without it being too much, she said \"absolutely,\" and did it in a way that was tasteful and really adorable. I loved our tasting, too, as she sent them through the post and we got to sample a lot of different (and delicious) flavours. From then I knew we were in safe hands! The cake was absolutely stunning to look at and to eat. Guests adored it (specifically the carrot cake!) and I couldn't be happier. Katie, thank you so much for your flexibility, your listening skills, your talent and your patience with us. We really feel you cared about our wedding day and giving us the perfect cake that encapsulated our personalities. If you're looking for someone to create a really special cake (and one that tastes amazing) for an event, we couldn't recommend Katie highly enough!",

The cake looked fantastic and she was really professional and responsive in making sure it was exactly what we wanted. She catered to my husband's nut allergy whilst still being able to offer us a wide range of flavours and the cake absolutely disappeared on the day as everyone loved it! Her pricing is also really reasonable compared to some of the specialist wedding cake providers I looked at.  I'd highly recommend her ",
