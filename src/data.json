On each occasion I gave Katie a brief or the birthday theme and she worked with me to design the toppers and gave me options to choose from, even a choice of flavours for the cupcakes. Katie added an extra special touch to each occasion, thank you and I would have no hesitation in recommending you to others in the future. \n",
