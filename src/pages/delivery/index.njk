        <p>I offer delivery across the region, with different arrangements for wedding and celebration cakes.</p> 
        <p>All wedding cakes are personally delivered and set up at your venue to ensure they arrive in perfect condition.</p>
        <p>Delivery charges vary depending on location - I regularly deliver throughout Berkshire and the surrounding counties, and have also travelled to venues in London, Worcestershire and along the south coast.</p>
