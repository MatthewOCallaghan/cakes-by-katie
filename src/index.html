                <h1>Hi, I'm Katieâ€¦</h1>

                <p>I'm a cake maker based in Thatcham, West Berkshire. I started baking and decorating cakes as a hobby from a young age with the dream that I could turn my passion into a career. Now I have a full time job as a cake decorator for a local
                    celebration cake company, and I have started this business on the side with the aim to go full time in the near future.</p>

                <p>As I only produce cakes part time, I am unable to take a lot of orders so if you are interested in me making a cake for your celebration please contact me as early as possible.</p>

                <p>I offer a wide range of flavours, and can cater for certain dietary requirements like dairy and gluten free.</p>
